    "One of the first things that most students learn about in linear algebra is the [determinant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinant) of a matrix.  Lots of useful formulas for 2×2 and 3×3 matrices can be expressed in terms of determinants, and determinants played a central role in linear algebra 100 years ago when most matrices were tiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, determinants are much less useful as a practical tool, although they still occasionally show up. Determinant-related formulas are also useful in proving theorems in linear algebra.   The basic computational problem, however, is that the determinant formulas don't scale — for a big matrix, there is almost always a better way of computing something than using explicit determinants, cofactors, [Cramer's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer's_rule), and other tricks useful for small matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, it is important to know what determinants are, and their basic properties.  In 18.06, we mainly use determinants as a *conceptual* tool to help us understand eigenvalues via the [characteristic polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characteristic_polynomial) — although, again, this is not a practical *computational* tool for eigenvalues, which are nowadays computed by very different methods."

Again, however, computational methods typically avoid computing determinants explicitly except for tiny matrices.\n",

One also often sees things like the [adjugate matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjugate_matrix) and the [Cayley–Hamilton theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Hamilton_theorem), both related to determinants.\n",
