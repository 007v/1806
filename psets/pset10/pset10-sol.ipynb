    "(From Strang, section 6.5, problem 15.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Show that if $m\\times m$ matrices $S$ and $T$ are positive-definite, then $S + T$ is positive-definite.  (Use one of the tests for positive-definiteness, from lecture or from the book.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "If $S,T$ are positive definite, then for all nonzero $x$ $x^HSx>0$ and $x^HTx>0$. In particular\n",
    "$$ x^H(S+T)x=x^HSx+x^HTx>0$$\n",

This matrix $M ^{-1} D^T K D$ is *not* symmetric, so at first you might be worried that you could get complex eigenvalues, and hence (physically impossible) exponentially growing or decaying solutions.\n",
