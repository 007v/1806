# Fall 2018 Lecture Summaries

This document is a *brief* summary of what was covered in each 18.06
lecture, along with links and suggestions for further reading.  It is
*not* a good substitute for attending lecture, but may provide a
useful study guide.

(You can also look at the analogous summaries from [Fall 2017](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/fall17/summaries.md).)

I'll try to update it within a day of each lecture.

## Lecture 1 (Feb 7)

Materials to be posted soon.

## Optional Julia Tutorial (Friday Feb 9, 5pm, 32-141)

On **Friday** at 5pm, there will be an optional tutorial session in 32-141
for the [Julia](http://julialang.org/) computer software that we will be using in 18.06 this
semester for homework and lecture demonstrations. Julia is a
programming language, but no "real" programming will be required in 18.06: we
will just be using it as a "fancy calculator" that happens to have
lots of linear algebra and other capabilities. The tutorial session is
optional; for the homework, we will mostly just give you code and tell
you to run it, perhaps with minor tweaks, in order to perform
computational experiments.  Bring your laptops, and try logging into
[juliabox.com](https://juliabox.com) beforehand.  More information:
