# Fall 2018 Lecture Summaries

This document is a *brief* summary of what was covered in each 18.06
lecture, along with links and suggestions for further reading.  It is
*not* a good substitute for attending lecture, but may provide a
useful study guide.

I'll try to update it within a day of each lecture.

## Lecture 1 (Feb 7)
