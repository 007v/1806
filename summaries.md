# Fall 2017 Lecture Summaries

This document is a *brief* summary of what was covered in each 18.06
lecture, along with links and suggestions for further reading.  It is
*not* a good substitute for attending lecture, but may provide a
useful study guide.

I'll try to update it within a day of each lecture.

## Lecture 1 (Sep 6)

* [course overview
slides](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/master/lectures/overview.pdf) and [Gaussian
elimination notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevengj/1806/blob/master/lectures/Gaussian-elimination.ipynb)
* [pset 1](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevengj/1806/blob/master/psets/pset1.ipynb) (due Wed 9/13, 11am in your recitation box)

Went over the [course overview
slides](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/master/lectures/overview.pdf)
giving the syllabus and the "big picture" of what 18.06 is about.

Then I started right in on [Gaussian
elimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination).  I
started with the "high school" method of writing out three equations
in three unknowns, adding/subtracting multiples of equations until we
were left with one equation in one unknown — at that point we can
solve it, then work backwards ("backsubstitution") through the
remaining equations until we know all the unknowns.  Then, I wrote the
same equations in matrix form, and renamed this process "Gaussian
elimination": we add/subtract multiples of matrix rows to introduce
zeros below the diagonal, i.e. to make the matrix [upper
triangular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix).   We want to do the same operations to the right-hand side, so we [augment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_matrix) the matrix with the right-hand side before starting Gaussian eliminations.

This process is quite tedious to do by hand, so I instead switched over to [Julia](http://julialang.org/) to do more computational exploration with [this Julia notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevengj/1806/blob/master/lectures/Gaussian-elimination.ipynb).  See [here for more information on using Julia](https://github.com/stevengj/julia-mit); you can also go to [juliabox.com](https://juliabox.com/) to use it online without installing anything.  To use the interactive widgets in the notebook from today, you will have to run it in Julia yourself:

1. Go to the [notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevengj/1806/blob/master/lectures/Gaussian-elimination.ipynb) and click on the *download icon* on the upper-right hand corner to download the file onto your computer

2. Log into juliabox (if you haven't installed Julia locally on your computer) and you will see a "dashboard" listing of notebooks.  *Drag* the `Gaussian-elimination.ipynb` file from your computer onto this dashboard to upload it.

3. Click the notebook in the dashboard to run it.

4. You can run individual cells by typing "shift-enter".  You can also run all of the cells at once (e.g. to create all of the interactive widgets) by choosing *Run All* from the *Cell* menu at the top.  (Note: if you have installed Julia on your own computer, you will need to run `Pkg.add("PyPlot")` and `Pkg.add("Interact")` first, if you have not done so already, in order to install the packages needed for this notebook.)

What comes next?  The problem with expressing Gaussian elimination this way, as operations on individual numbers in the matrix, is that it is impossible to follow the process in detail for anything except a very tiny matrix.   We need a higher-level way to express the process, both to help us understand it and also to help us to *use* it (e.g. to perform additional algebraic transformations afterwards).   To do this, we want to express the process, not as operations on individual numbers, but as [multiplications of whole matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication).

In particular, our goal in the next lectures will be to find a matrix E such that multiplying both sides of Ax=b by E (on the left) transforms it into upper-triangular form.  That is, Gaussian elimination turns Ax=b into EAx=Ux=Eb=c, where U is upper triangular.  *Amazing fact*: it will turn out that E is *lower* triangular, and that by writing U=EA we have effectively written A=E⁻¹U=LU, where L is lower triangular too.  This is called the [LU factorization of A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition), and is an *incredibly useful* way to look at Gaussian elimination.  The computer gives us L and U, and then given those matrices it turns out that we can figure out lots of things that would have been hard to do with A alone.

## Lecture 2 (Sep 8)

* [Matrix-multiplication and LU notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevengj/1806/blob/master/lectures/Matrix-mult-perspectives.ipynb)

Went over several different perspectives on matrix multiplication: the *same arithmetic operations* can be viewed as row×columns, matrix×columns, rows×matrix, columns×rows, and more.   If you are doing hand calculations (but who does that, really?), rows×columns is probably the easiest.  But the other viewpoints help us *think* about matrix multiplication in different ways, both to understand what is going on and also to *design* matrices to perform certain operations.

Using this understanding, we rewrote Gaussian elimination in matrix form: we multiply a matrix A on the *left* by a sequence of **lower**-triangular elimination matrices to arrive at an **upper**-triangular matrix U.    This turns out to be *extremely* useful
as both a computational and a theoretical tool, because triangular matrices are much easier to work with than general matrices — we've already seen that it is easy to solve triangular systems of equations, and we will find that they are nice in other ways as well.

In the next lecture, we will reverse the elimination steps to obtain the [LU factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition) A=LU.

## Lecture 3 (Sep 11)

* [Matrix inverse and LU notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevengj/1806/blob/master/lectures/Inverses-LU-intro.ipynb)

Introduction to the concept of a matrix inverse via the identity matrix.  Key ideas from the notebook:

* I is an identity matrix, the matrix that gives Ix=x for any x or IA=A and AI=A for any A.  There are m×m identity matrices for all m, and when we write "I" we usually infer from context how big an I we mean.
* A⁻¹ is the matrix that does the "reverse" of A: if Ax=b, then A⁻¹b=x (for any x).  (Equivalently, it gives the solution to Ax=b.)  It only exists for **square, nonsingular** matrices A.  (i.e. an m×m matrix A must give m nonzero pivots when you do elimination.)
* Equivalently, A⁻¹ is the matrix for which A⁻¹A = A⁻¹A = I (the m×m identity matrix).
* An important property: (AB)⁻¹ = B⁻¹A⁻¹.

Our first application is not to compute general matrix inverses, but rather to invert the elimination steps from the last lecture and compute the [LU factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LU_decomposition) A=LU of a matrix.  Inverting elimination steps is easy — by inspection, whenever we subtracted a multiple of a row, to invert it we just add instead — and turns out to be just flipping the signs of the entries below the diagonal.  Key idea:

* Gaussian elimination EA=U (without row swaps) can be thought of as A=LU: factorizing A into a **product of two simpler (triangular) matrices** (L=lower, U=upper).  U is the matrix that you normally get when you do elimination by hand, and L (the inverse of the elimination steps L=E⁻¹, a lower-triangular matrix with 1's on the diagonal) is essentially a *"record" of the elimination steps*.
* Computing L and U is hard (elimination is a lot of work, even for a computer), but once you have L and U then many things that you might want to do with A become easy.
  - For example, suppose you want to solve Ax=b, given A=LU.  Write LUx=b=L(Ux), and let y=Ux.  Then Ly=b, and we can solve for y by forward-substitution.  Given y, we can then solve Ux=y by back-substitution.  Both of these steps are easy because the systems are triangular.
  - This means that we can re-use L and U to solve Ax=b for *many right-hand sides*.   In contrast, if you "augment" A with b and then do elimination (A|b)⟶(U|y), you get the *same* new right-hand side y but you haven't kept a record of the elimination steps, so if you have a new right-hand side you might naively repeat the whole elimination process (hard!) rather than solving Ly=b (easy!).

In the next lecture (which will start with the end of this notebook), we will look at calculating inverses more generally (although it turns out that this is something that you should almost never do explicitly, even on a computer!).   I gave a quick preview of how to do it: from AA⁻¹ = I, it turns out that we just need to solve Ax=b for a sequence of right-hand sides b.  If the b's are the columns of I, then the x's will be the columns of A⁻¹!  And solving each of these right-hand sides is easy once you have A=LU.  (This is essentially how the computer gets A⁻¹ when you do `inv(A)`.)

## Optional Julia Tutorial (Monday Sep 11, 5pm, 32-155)

On **Monday** at 5pm, there will be an optional tutorial session in 32-155
for the [Julia](http://julialang.org/) computer software that we will be using in 18.06 this
semester for homework and lecture demonstrations. Julia is a
programming language, but no "real" programming will be required in 18.06: we
will just be using it as a "fancy calculator" that happens to have
lots of linear algebra and other capabilities. The tutorial session is
optional; for the homework, we will mostly just give you code and tell
you to run it, perhaps with minor tweaks, in order to perform
computational experiments.  Bring your laptops, and try logging into
[juliabox.com](https://juliabox.com) beforehand.  More information:

* [Instructions/links for using Julia](https://github.com/stevengj/julia-mit/)
* [Overview slides](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/master/julia/Julia-intro.pdf)
* [Julia cheatsheet](https://github.com/stevengj/1806/blob/master/julia/Julia-cheatsheet.pdf)
* [Tutorial notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevengj/1806/blob/master/julia/tutorial.ipynb)

## Lecture 4 (Sep 13)

* [Matrix inverses and complexity](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stevengj/1806/blob/master/lectures/Inverses-Complexity-Transposes.ipynb)

Went through how to explicitly compute A⁻¹ by solving AA⁻¹ = I.  In particular, went through the Gauss–Jordan algorithm (on a 3×3 example that can also be found in the textbook): If we do row operations on A to get I, then the *same* row operations on I give A⁻¹!  To carry this out by hand, we augment (A|I), do ordinary Gaussian elimination to get (U|C), and then do elimination "upwards" to get (I|A⁻¹).  (This is not in the Julia notebook, but can be found in the textbook.)

In practice, people hardly ever do Gauss–Jordan anymore to get inverses by hand.  (For 2×2 and 3×3 matrices, you can just [google the formula](https://www.dr-lex.be/random/matrix-inv.html) for the inverse, while for larger matrices hand computation is too annoying to be practical.)  However, it *is* important to understand *why* it works, because understanding that gets at the heart of what elimination and inverses truly are.

Going through the Gauss–Jordan process also highlights how much unnecessary work it normally is to compute a matrix inverse.  For an m×m matrix A, finding A⁻¹ involves all the work to do Gaussian elimination on A *plus* all of the work to solve m right-hand-sides (the columns of I).   If you just want to solve Ax=b, you would have to be crazy to compute A⁻¹ first and then multiply A⁻¹b to get x — instead, just solve Ax=b directly, either via `A \ b` (on a computer) or by augmenting (A|b) and doing elimination and backsubstitution by hand.  Even if you have many right-hand sides, it is almost always a better idea to compute the LU factorization of A and then do back/forward-substitution for each new right-hand side.

This does not mean that matrix inverses are useless!  However, they are mainly a *conceptual* tool that we use to move matrices around *symbolically* in equations.   Once you are through with your algebraic manipulations, you might end up with an expression like A⁻¹b — but when it comes time to actually *compute* the answer, you should **read "A⁻¹b" as "solve Ax=b for x by the best available method"**.

* Complexity of matrix operations: why matrix × vector or backsubstitution scale like n² for n×n matrices, while matrix × matrix or Gaussian elimination (LU factorization) scale like n³.   Matrices much bigger than a few thousand square quickly become impractical, and really large problems are only tractable because they have special structure like sparsity.

(*Skipped the sections of the notebook on transposes and permutations, for now!*)
